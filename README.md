Data mining of historical Olympics dataset using K-NN and cluster analysis in R

The data was sourced from:
Griffin, R. (2018, May). Historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games. Retrieved from 
www.sports-reference.com

The dataset was on the modern Olympic Games, including 271,116 observations with 15 variables corresponding to Olympic 
athletes competing at the games from 1896 to 2016.

The code used several data mining techniques to see if it was possible to predict whether an athlete would win gold, silver or bronze based on 7 features.
The data mining methods were hierarcichal clustering, KNN and Naive Bayes Classifier.
Unsupervised outlier detection was also used to detect outliers.
ANOVA was also used to verify results from the data mining methods.
